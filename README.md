# health-care-project
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 36 months of hospital operations data, identifying patterns between bed occupancy, staff responsiveness, and patient safety outcomes.
Cleaned and pre-processed raw hospital datasets using Python (pandas, NumPy) to handle missing values, outliers, and standardize time-series data for reliable analysis.

Applied correlation and regression techniques to test the hypothesis that higher bed occupancy reduces staff responsiveness and increases unassisted bed fall rates.

Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize occupancy trends, staff performance metrics, and fall rates, enabling hospital administrators to track KPIs in real time.

Developed custom DAX measures in Power BI to calculate staff response times and fall rate ratios, providing actionable insights for workload management.

Identified a negative correlation (-0.62) between occupancy and staff responsiveness and a positive correlation (+0.58) between occupancy and fall rates, validating the hypothesis with statistical evidence.

Delivered actionable recommendations that suggested optimal staffing ratios and patient allocation strategies, leading to a potential 12% reduction in fall incidents in simulated scenarios.

Documented methodology and findings in a structured report, combining Python-based analytics and Power BI dashboards, showcasing end-to-end data storytelling and healthcare analytics skills
